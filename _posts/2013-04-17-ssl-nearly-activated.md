I just bought this morning a SSL certificate.

Main goal is to provide more privacy to my users, and also being able to use it for the websocket connection.

PS: I recently heard weird stuffs regarding proxies and non-physical firewalls that 
were able to forbid TCP over HTTP which is exactly what websockets are based on...

Edit: I mean on port 80. It works fine over 443.
