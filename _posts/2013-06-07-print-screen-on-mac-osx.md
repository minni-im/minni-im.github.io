There is something super simple that irritates me on Mac OS X since I switched: What about the `Print Screen` key !

It's not that I absolutely want to have a physical key on the keyboard, but it is so stupidly easy to capture the screen or just an application on Windows.
You just need this feature all day long, especially with an intensive chat usage.

Of course you can also do it on Mac OS X, but who the hell is mentally sane enough to remember this %&*#@!$$ keyboard shorcut!!
So I finally found a [guide](http://guides.macrumors.com/Taking_Screenshots_in_Mac_OS_X) referencing all theses shortcuts, even the most interresting ones, those who paste directly into the clipboard (as `Print Screen` would have done)

If you want to generate an image file

* **&#8984; + shift + 3**: Take a screenshot of the screen, and save it as a file on the desktop
* **&#8984; + shift + 4, then select an area**: Take a screenshot of an area and save it as a file on the desktop
* **&#8984; + shift + 4, then space, then click a window**: Take a screenshot of a window and save it as a file on the desktop

If you are more into the clipboard

* **&#8984; + control + shift + 3**: Take a screenshot of the screen, and save it to the clipboard
* **&#8984; + control + shift + 4, then select an area**: Take a screenshot of an area and save it to the clipboard
* **&#8984; + control + shift + 4, then space, then click a window**: Take a screenshot of a window and save it to the clipboard

By the way, if you are more a Windows guy, I suggest you have a look at [greenshot](http://getgreenshot.org/), it's absolutely fantastic !
