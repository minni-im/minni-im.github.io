The beta has been privately launched during last week-end.
For the luckiest of you that have access to this beta, _do not forget to refresh your webapp everyday_,
paying extra attention to cleaning your browser cache.

The client-side javascript is not yet optimized in a way i'm satisfied with.

The goal to fix this stupid cache issue is to add a md5 hash in each javascript filename.
With this implemented, I'll have the ability to set an infinite expiry date for those files in [Nginx][nginx].
