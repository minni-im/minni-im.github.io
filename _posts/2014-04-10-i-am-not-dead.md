Hello there !

It's been a while since I posted something here, so I, first, would apologize for that.

### You're not dead. Are you sure ?

Having the motivation to write is not simple. Having an idea of what to talk about is even harder,
and finally, being able to write it down using simple words is out of range!
Especially for me, as I am not a native english writer. I am french, but I mostly speak english at work on a daily basis.

But I am motivated, so let's try to have a few words about tech topics related to the development of roulotte.
That should be doable.

### Good news &amp; upcoming changes

I have been working for a while on a UI redesign. I am not at all a designer,
but I usually kinda like to play a bit with pixels and colors (even if I am colorblind).
So every single visual stuff in roulotte has been patiently crafted by myself.

Lately, I tought I should concentrate on finding a proper branding instead of fixing [bugs](https://bitbucket.org/bcharbonnier/roulotte/issues). It always had been some kind of false priority to me.
So I tried, retried, erased it, retried again, and finally I got something. It was there, right in front of me.

The blog is the first one to benefit from this new style and branding. I spent some time scracthing my head to find a
nice logo for roulotte.  Nevertheless I must admit that I am really happy and proud of the outcome.

Here is the (let's hope) final version of the new brand logos I produced
