roulotte.im is a private, hosted chat server. It's a dedicated workplace for you and your coworkers.

### Why roulotte.im

Email is slow. Meetings minutes are sidetracked. IM just does not work for groups.

The goal behind roulotte.im is to help you share text, images, code and files for instant
decision making.
Your company/team/organistion deserve to be a more productive and funnier place.

Here is a taste of some features:

- **Web client**
  Nothing to install. Works everywhere. Just login and focus on collaborating with your coworkers.

- **Search and Archives**
  All your chat logs are searchable. You decide which rooms should be archived, for one day, one week or forever.

- **Notifications**
  Never miss a thing from your chat rooms. Benefit from desktop notifications, activate sound blips for each new messages.

- **Instant preview**
  Anything that is an image, or an animated gif will be displayed right into your chat.

- **Access control**
  Use rooms for your departments, teams, or projects. Make them open for anyone to join, or private for only people invited.

### Team

Today, roulotte.im is a one guy story, my story.

Stay tuned for the coming launch
