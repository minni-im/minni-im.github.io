I have just pushed this morning a new feature: Dynamic status for everyone.

Pretty simple, for now you can't drive this status, it's only automatic. You'll go from *available* to *idle*
after 2 minutes of inactivity, and finaly switch to *away* after 10 min.

Next step associated to this feature is to introduce a *busy* status, that would for example deactivate 
all notifications, and also add the ability for you to manually select the *away* status.

That's it for today.
